Data files are provided here. They are output from the Falls Lake ABM at https://github.com/maskarb/FallsLakeABM. Four management scenarios are simulated for 16 shifting climate scenarios. Management Scenario 1 is no management. Management Scenarion 2 is retrofitting. Management Scenario 3 is retrofitting with light drought restrictions. Management Scenario 4 is retrofitting with severe drought restrictions. The 16 shifting climate scenarios correspond to shifting factors equal to 0.25 - 1.0, increasing in 0.05 increments. For each of the 64 settings (16 climate settings X 4 management scenarios), 50 simulations were run to capture stochasticity. Data files describe the storage and deficit for each of the simulations in million cubic meters, reported at a monthly timestep.

The procedure used to create shifting climates is described here: https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/handle/1840.20/36907. Managment strategies are described here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221067071630453X.
